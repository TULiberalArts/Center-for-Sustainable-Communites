## Symposium on Transdisciplinary Sustainability Science
The symposium took place in March 22-23, 2018. It brought together scholars working on the social, environmental, economic, policy and cultural dimensions of sustainability science to inspire and outline the next frontier of research on sustainability science. The aim of the event was to identify gaps, provide a conceptual framework, and outline a transdisciplinary sustainability science research agenda with key questions and funding strategies for research proposals. The event focused on three themes: i) envisioning sustainable futures; ii) institutional and technological transitions toward sustainability and iii) defining the role of transdisciplinary science and academics on the implementation of transformational policies toward sustainability. Topics discussed included energy transitions and/or socio-technological change; institutional transformations and governance mechanisms for sustainability; urban growth and urban footprint, urban-rural interdependencies; societal values, science communication; ecosystem change; climate, health and wellbeing; food production, consumption and access; sustainable use of water resources; and social, economic and environmental inequalities.
