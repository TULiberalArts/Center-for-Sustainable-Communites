The Center for Sustainable Communities (CSC) develops and promotes new approaches to protect and preserve quality of life through sustainable development. We conduct social and environmental research on sustainability - how can we make decisions that maintain or enhance economic and community well-being while protecting the environment on which we depend? The CSC draws on Temple University Ambler's historical focus and strength in horticulture, landscape architecture and environmental studies. Associated Temple University faculty come from disciplines that include geology, geography, urban studies, land use policy and planning, environmental justice and chemistry. The center is a working resource for government agencies, community organizations and developers. We provide objective information and services to improve decision-making relative to land use and water resources planning and development.
