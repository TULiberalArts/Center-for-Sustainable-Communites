The Center for Sustainable Communities (CSC) develops and promotes new approaches to protect and preserve quality of life through sustainable development. We act as a resource for government agencies, community organizations, and developers, providing objective information and services to improve decision-making relative to land use and water resources planning and development.

A working resource for government agencies, community organizations, and developers, the CSC provides objective information and services to improve decision-making relative to land use and water resources planning and development. The Center conducts interdisciplinary research and offers educational and community outreach programs.

The CSC was designed to build on Temple University Ambler’s historical focus and strengths in horticulture, landscape architecture, and environmental studies, while drawing upon the expertise of all Temple University faculty. Associated faculty come from various disciplines, including landscape architecture, horticulture, geology, geography, urban and suburban studies, land use policy and planning, environmental economics, environmental justice, and chemistry.

Temple University Ambler Campus has an optimal geographic location and history of environmental protection and land-use planning uniquely position it to serve as a regional and national resource to foster interdisciplinary research and education, facilitate collaborative planning, encourage community partnerships, and disseminate information on the development and management of sustainable communities.
