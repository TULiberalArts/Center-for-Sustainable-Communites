The Center for Sustainable Communities conducts interdisciplinary research and offers educational and community outreach programs to address environmental and quality of life issues. 

## [Brownsfields Revisioning Project](https://tyler.temple.edu/brownfields-revisioning-project)
Location: North Kensington, Philadelphia
Status: Ongoing
The CSC Brownsfields Revisioning Project proposes and implements cleanup and reuse strategies for North Kensington using research obtained through community engagement, existing conditions, potential resources and our partners. A brownfield is a property whose redevelopment or use is complicated by the potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants. Neighborhoods blighted by brownfields also experience high vacancy rates, weak economies and are often former industrial hubs. These difficulties impact economic, social, public health and environmental justice concerns within the project area, and significantly hamper development.
